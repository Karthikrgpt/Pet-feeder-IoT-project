# Pet-feeder-IoT-project
This advanced machine can provide real-time food to the animal and monitor the animal's behaviour. The IoT Based Automatic pet food feeder uses an ESP-32 CAM camera module, Ultrasonic sensor, and Motor control module and consists of an interface with a DC servo motor and other hardware equipment.
Pet feeders will help you keep your dog or cat at a healthy weight, whether you're at home or out and about, and can also help pets with diabetes, or who are following a specific diet.
